## About Lara-Graphql

This is a GraphQL-Powered Laravel API.
Built with the help of [Laravel GraphQL](https://github.com/rebing/graphql-laravel).

It is a mini-project that one can use to upload document files to local storage or AWS S3 bucket.

If you choose to upload to both locations, it will store the AWS url in the database.

Front-end built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
